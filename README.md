Bunch-O-Blocks-Mod-for-Minecraft
================================

A 1.7.10 Minecraft Forge mod that expands upon certain mods' content. This mod intents to add blocks/items/machines 
that I (the author) feel should be included in their source mods but aren't and improves upon areas that I feel are lacking.

##Issue Reporting

Please include the following:

* Minecraft version
* Blood Magic version
* Forge version/build
* Versions of any mods potentially related to the issue
* Any relevant screenshots are greatly appreciated.
* For crashes:
 * Steps to reproduce
 * ForgeModLoader-client-0.log (the FML log) from the root folder of the client 

##Development Setup

1. Fork this project to your own Github repository and clone it to your desktop.
2. Navigate to the directory you cloned to. Open a command window there and run `gradlew setupDevWorkspace` then (if you use Eclipse) `gradlew eclipse` or (if you use IDEA) `gradlew idea`. 
3. This process will setup [Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/), your workspace, and link [MineTweaker](http://minetweaker3.powerofbytes.com/) as a dependency.
4. Open the project in your IDE of choice.
5. Set `../src/api/java` (If applicable) as a source directory.
